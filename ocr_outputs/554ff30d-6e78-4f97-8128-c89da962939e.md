Abstract.Withtheaccelerationof technologicalinnovation,efficientretrievaland classificationof patentliteraturehavebecome essentialforintellectualproperty managementandenterpriseR&D. Traditionalkeyword- andrule-basedretrieval methodsoften failto address complex query intents or capture semantic associations across technical domains, resulting in incomplete and low-relevance results. This study presents an automated patent retrieval framework integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) withRetrieval-AugmentedGeneration(RAG) technology. The system comprises three components: (1) a preprocessing module for patent data standardization,(2)ahigh-efficiencyvectorretrievalengine leveragingLLMgenerated embeddings, and (3) a RAG-enhanced query module that combines external documentretrieval with context-aware response generation. Evaluations were conductedon the GooglePatents dataset (2006–2024), containing millionsof global patent records with metadata such as filing date, domain, and status. The proposed gpt3.5-turbo-0125+RAG configuration achieved 80.5% semantic matching accuracy and 92.1%recall,surpassingbaselineLLMmethodsby_28percentage points. The framework alsodemonstrated strong generalization in cross-domain classification and semantic clustering tasks. These results validate the effectiveness of LLM—RAG integration for intelligent patent retrieval, providing a foundation for next-generation AI-driven intellectual property analysis platforms.

### 1. Introduction 

In the context of today's rapid knowledge expansion and technological innovation, patents serve as a critical indicator of technological advancement and intellectual property protection.With millions of patents issued by more than a dozen global patent offices,the challenge of efficientlyandaccuratelyretrievingrelevantdocumentsfrom massive patentdatabases has become a major bottleneck for technological intelligence mining and enterprise R&D decisionmaking. Traditional patent search methods,whichrelyheavilyonkeyword matchingand manuallydesignedrules,oftenfailto capturethenuancedintent behindqueriesordetect semantic relationships across technical domains—leading to limited recall and low relevance in retrieved results [1].
